## Description of project 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

### For each record it is provided:

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
*  An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



## Files in datasets 

* train/X_train.txt: Training set.

* train/y_train.txt: Training labels.

* test/X_test.txt: Test set.

* test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

* features.txt: List of all features.

* "train/subject_train.txt": Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. (Note: it's the same for TEST)




## Descriptions about the features:  

* The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time). 

* The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ). 

* The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 

* The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

* A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
* 3 axial signals X, Y and Z directions  were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern "XYZ".
